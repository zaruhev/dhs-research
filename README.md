# Object Remembrance using Monocular Depth Estimation
In this project, we implement object remembrance for out-of-view objects in a real-world scene by implementing point cloud generation using depth maps created via monocular depth estimation.

This repository handles the static image -> point cloud pipeline. The pipeline will be an installable module. Instructions for installing the module will be provided upon its first deployable update.
